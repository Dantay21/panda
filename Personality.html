        <H1>I belive my hobbys and traits depict me</H1><hr>
        <p>My hobbies are surfing the internet and working on projects with individuals, this  aligns with school as I am currently doing a computer science degree and working on projects with different languges gives me a jump start in school as some of the languages used for the projects are used for modules for example python. My traits are determination and commitment being able to commit to doing things has really assisted me to remain at the top of my classes and my determination to continue trying when tough topics roll around also help in that reguard.</p>
